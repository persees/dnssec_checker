# dnssec_checker
A simple script to check if DNSSEC is enabled in a service(s)

## How to use
It's quite simple! You should have a .txt file with the domain names that you want to check named "list.txt" in the same directory as the .sh script.

The script will run a few checks to see if some of the important flags/responses are set and populate a .csv sheet with the information.
